        <h3>What domains are measured?</h3>

        <p>
          Pulse measures DAP participation for <strong>publicly accessible <code>.gov</code> domains</strong> in the federal government's <strong>executive branch</strong>. Domains which do nothing but redirect to other websites <strong>are not measured</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This currently amounts to around 800 domains.

        <h3>How to participate</h3>

        <p>
          Any publicly accessible federal website in the executive branch can participate in the <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">Digital Analytics Program</a> (DAP). The easiest way to get started is to <a href="mailto:dap@gsa.gov">send the DAP team an email</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once an agency has established a relationship with the DAP, the agency will be asked to incorporate the DAP's <a href="https://github.com/digital-analytics-program/gov-wide-code">government-wide JavaScript code</a> into their website(s). For detailed implementation guidance, data and privacy details, and other information, review the <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/common-questions-about-dap-faq/">Digital Analytics Program FAQ</a>.

            Measurement is performed by comparing the set of evaluated <code>.gov</code> domains to the <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/data/sites.csv">list of participating federal domains and subdomains</a> published by the DAP. This list is created by looking at reported web traffic in the DAP's underlying database.
